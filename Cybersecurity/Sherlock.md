## What is Sherlock?

Sherlock is a Python-based tool designed to find usernames across many social networks. It's particularly useful for researchers, cybersecurity professionals, and anyone interested in finding a user's presence across multiple platforms.

### History

- **Created**: Sherlock was created in early 2019.
- **Creator**: Sherlock was developed by Siddharth Dushantha.

---

### Purpose

Sherlock was created to provide a simple yet powerful tool to discover the presence of a username across a wide array of social media platforms. This can be useful for:

- **Security Research**: To check if a username has been compromised across different platforms.
- **Digital Footprint Analysis**: To understand a user's presence and activity across social media.
- **Investigative Journalism**: To find all accounts associated with a particular username.

### How It Works

Sherlock works by sending HTTP requests to a predefined list of social media platforms and checking if the username exists on those platforms. It parses the responses to determine if the username is registered on each site.
